* Program Description:
* 	This program will copy files from the MSTAR distribution set to 
* disk.  The program has one required argument, the tape drive to read 
* from, and one optional argument, the datafile that is used to retrieve
* tape names.
*
* The calling sequence is therefore:
* 	% mstar_extract drive [ -l mstar_datafile ]
*
* 	Also, if not specified the MSTAR distribution table of contents
* file, mstar_datafiles, must be in the current working directory.
* 	if no tape drive or a non_existing tape drive is specified then
* the only a list of tapes will be printed.
*
* 	After running the program, the program will wait for the user to 
* enter the filenames to be copied to disk.  The program will read 
* filenames from stdin until it reads an end-of-file mark (a ^D on UNIX 
* machines).  This allows for the redirecting of a filenames from a file
* from It will then dd the files from tape to disk using a block size of 
* 8192, prompting the user whenever a new tape is needed.
*
* 	The program verifies that the file is the proper file by checking 
* the filename parameter in the summary header.  If this filename does 
* not match the filename requested, an error is reported.

Note:  In order for the program to work properly, the drive specified in 
the command line must be the no rewind version.
