                                  [MSTAR2TIFF]
                        (Version 2.0, 24 September 1998)

Program Description:

   This routine allows you to convert the magnitude portion of
   MSTAR images to 8-bit TIFF format for DISPLAY purposes. It
   contains options to automatically enhance the output image,
   dump the Phoneix header to an output file, and to operate
   in verbose or quiet mode. It automatically checks for and
   byteswaps the big-endian MSTAR data when needed to support 
   PC display operations.


Program Usage:

     mstar2tiff -i <MSTAR File> -o <TIFF File> [-e] [-h] [-v]

           Options: [-e]  = Auto-contrast enhance [Def: none]
                    [-h]  = Dump Phoenix (ASCII) header [Def: none]
                    [-v]  = Verbose mode [Def: Quiet]


Description of Arguments:

  REQUIRED:
           <MSTAR File> -- Input file in MSTAR format
           <TIFF File > -- Name of output TIFF file

  OPTIONAL:
           [-e] = Auto-contrast enhance switch
           [-h] = Dump Phoenix header switch
           [-v] = Operate in verbose mode switch


Files Necessary to Compile:

     * Include : tiff.h   (Contains TIFF defs.)
	Include files can also be found in the libtiff-devel and libjpeg-turbo-devel rpms for CentOS/Redhat 6.

     * Library : TIFF 6.0 libtiff library 
                 (You can download latest version of library
                  via http: download.osgeo.org/libtiff)

     * Source  : mstar2tiff.c
                 read_switch.c

     * Make    : mstar2tiff.mk (optional)


Compiling and Linking Code:

   You can compile mstar2tiff either from the command line or by using the 
   included makefile (note: .mk file).

   a) Command line Method:

        % gcc -c read_switch.c [enter]
        % gcc -o mstar2tiff mstar2tiff.c read_switch.o -ltiff [enter]
      
      NOTE: You can use other C compilers. Edit .mk file as necessary.

   b) Using the Makefile [mstar2tiff.mk]:

      Perform the following steps:

        % make -f mstar2tiff.mk       [Creates executable: mstar2tiff]
